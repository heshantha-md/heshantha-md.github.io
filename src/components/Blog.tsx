                    <p>Hey fellow coder! Hope you’re doing well. Today, I’ve decided to talk about the SOLID principle. I know it might seem a bit scary, and you probably don’t even understand what SOLID stands for yet. But fear not, my fellow friend. In this article, we’re not just going to learn what the acronym SOLID stands for, we’re also going to explore the advantages of each principle and how we can bring these concepts into our Swift code. Cool, right?</p>

                    <p>Hey there, fellow coder! Today, we’re diving into the cool world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and seeing how incredibly advantageous it is for us to apply these principles in our Swift codebase. Just like LEGOs let us build anything from simple cars to complex spaceship, OOP gives us the tools to organize, scale, and reuse our code efficiently. So, let’s stack those bricks and dive deep into the core concepts of OOP to understand how they benefit our Swift projects.</p>

                    <p>Hello, fellow coder! This is part two of our “Dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Swift” article series, where today we’ll discuss one of the main OOP concepts: Inheritance. If you haven’t read the first article of the series, “Dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Swift — Part 1”. I highly recommend you take a look at it to get a basic understanding of OOP concepts, such as classes, objects, and how OOP concepts are applied in the real world. Now, let’s get started, shall we?</p>

                    <p>Hey, fellow coder! Welcome back to our Dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Swift series. If you haven’t checked out the previous articles, I highly recommend starting with “Dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Swift — Part 1” to grasp the basics of OOP concepts like classes and objects, and “Dive into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Swift — Part 2” to understand inheritance. Today, we’ll explore another fundamental OOP concept: Polymorphism.</p>

                    <p>Hey there, fellow code explorer! Ready to onboard on a journey through the fascinating world of Big O notation? Buckle up, because we’re about to make understanding algorithms as easy as pie! What’s the Big Deal with Big O? Imagine you’re on a quest to find the legendary treasure buried deep within a maze of code. To navigate through this labyrinth, you need a map, a map that tells you how fast your code will run and how much memory it’ll eat up. That’s where Big O notation dives in like a superhero!</p>

                    <p>Hey there, fellow Swift enthusiast! Ever wondered about those funky symbols like &, |, and ^ in Swift? Well, get ready to onboard on an exciting journey into the world of bitwise operations! These handy tricks are super useful for all sorts of cool stuff in programming. Bitwise AND (&) Okay, so imagine you have two numbers, and you want to compare them bit by bit. If both bits are 1, we get a 1. Otherwise, it's a 0. Simple, right?</p>
